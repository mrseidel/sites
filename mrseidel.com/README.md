# Website development location

This repo is mainly used to hold a copy of www.mrseidel.com.  This will be
keeping track of the website, and any changes that I make as time goes on.

The main site will be updated once in a while with the changes shown in this
repo.  The repo will _most likely_ be ahead of the website.

If you have any suggestions or changes you'd like to see for the website,
feel free to open an issue.
